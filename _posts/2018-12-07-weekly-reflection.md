  My flag is rectangular with a sideways triangle that has a white star inside with blue and white stripes going down the flag.The Cuban flag is at a length-to-width ratio of 2:1. The blue and white alternating stripes are of equal width. The red chevron is in the shape of an equilateral triangle that does not extend to the middle of the flag. The star within the chevron has a radius that is ​3⁄20 the length of the hoist. Its middle is halfway up the flag.
  In class I got the Puerto Rican flag but I wanted to change to the Cuban flag
Because it is the same but just different colors in which I liked better. But
When I started doing the flag i noticed that i took the flag with the most common 
Colors which was red,white,and blue. Another challenged Iahd was with the star that
I needed to put at the start of the flag. I really don’t know how to draw a star and also cut it .
So i told my friend to do it which was then the star was to small.

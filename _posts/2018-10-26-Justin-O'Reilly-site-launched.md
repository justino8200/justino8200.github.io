When I first starded Mr.Allatta class i was just joking around and play with my friends and also laughing a lot but after the first week of class I started to pay attention a little bit more because this class was the whole point i came to this school learn about computers. Know i have grown more knowledge in coding and its all thamks to Mr.Alatta. 1/3 of of the semester and i have learned a lot. Math class and computer science has a lot of common things like for example in amth class we talk about functions like in Mr.Allatta class and also we add subtract multiply etc in math and Mrt.Allatta class.This weekly refelction for Mr.Allatta class we have to make connections with our math class my connection is domain and range in which Mr.Allatta we talk about domain and range to use wesheme and create images with domain and range. ALso in amth class we use domain and range for a graph in which we use to plot lines on the graph.

This week we have to study because me and the rest of my classametes are getting an midterm so we have to pay attention to all of what we learn in class,also we got back into getting background players and targets for out video game. So todays class objective was to out everything together on the background of our game. Which was pretty challenging because reziseing everything and having to get the right size was pretty hard but at the end of the day i learned something new.

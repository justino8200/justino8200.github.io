bitmap/url is something i learned in Mr.allatta class yesterday on novemeber 1 2018 and that is the big idea of the week. 
Bitmap/url is a code that takes in a string and then produces an image. ;bitmap/url:string->image. Also something else that we
learned was what is a contract. A contract is a setup that you need you add an image.

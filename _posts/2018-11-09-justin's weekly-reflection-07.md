In class I'm learning about WeSheme and how to define gt to get an image. But we only got Mr.Allatta 2 times this week and we learned a lot in just 2 days and also my freinds are becoming more involed in class prsenting infront of the class. Now im more comfartable in using WeSheme and start coding with it.

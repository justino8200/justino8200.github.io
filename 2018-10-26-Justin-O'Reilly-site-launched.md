When I first starded Mr.Allatta class i was just joking around and play with my friends and also laughing a lot but after the first week of class I started to pay attention a little bit more because this class was the whole point i came to this school learn about computers. Know i have grown more knowledge in coding and its all thamks to Mr.Alatta. 1/3 of of the semester and i have learned a lot. Math class and computer science has a lot of common things like for example in amth class we talk about functions like in Mr.Allatta class and also we add subtract multiply etc in math and Mrt.Allatta class
